backend/bill_verification.py
==============================
Bill ingestion and verification for the ASIC ERS pilot credit facility.
Every disbursement must trace back to exactly one approved bill; this
module is where a submitted bill becomes (or fails to become) eligible
to be paid.

Design rules:
- Nothing here auto-approves a bill on low-confidence extraction, a name
  mismatch, or any fraud/alteration indicator — those always route to
  `manual_review`, never straight to `verified` or straight to
  `rejected`. Only unambiguous, objective failures (unsupported biller,
  unsupported category, duplicate, already paid) are rejected outright.
- An approved bill gets an immutable cryptographic hash
  (`compute_bill_hash`) recorded before anything else can reference it.
  A disbursement links to that hash, not to a mutable file path, so
  "which bill was this payment actually for" can never be quietly
  changed after the fact.
- Duplicate and already-paid detection run against BOTH the exact file
  hash and the (biller, biller_reference, amount, due_date) tuple, since
  a customer might upload a re-scanned or re-photographed copy of the
  same bill with a different hash.
