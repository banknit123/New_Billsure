"""
backend/pilot_api.py
======================
Real HTTP endpoints for the ASIC ERS pilot — the piece every prior
session's evidence pack flagged as missing ("tested, standalone
module, not wired into any real API endpoint yet"). This closes that
gap for the core customer journey exercised by
`test_end_to_end_dummy_customer_journey.py`.

DELIBERATELY A SEPARATE APP from `server.py` (the existing 150KB+
bill-smoothing product), not a modification of it:
- `server.py` is a live product with real infrastructure behind it
  (per CLAUDE.md) — this workstream has consistently avoided touching
  it or the live database it points to.
- This app can be run and deployed entirely independently
  (`uvicorn pilot_api:app`), pointed at its own sandbox database via
  its own `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` env vars (the pilot
  migrations 012-023 have never been applied to the live database —
  point this app at a NEW project, not the live one).
- It can optionally be mounted under the main app later
  (`main_app.mount("/pilot", pilot_app)`) once someone deliberately
  decides to do that — not assumed here.

FAIL-CLOSED BY DEFAULT: every endpoint that would move real money or
activate a real customer still passes through the same fail-closed
checks as the underlying modules (pilot_config, launch_gates,
credit_ledger, etc.) — this API layer adds HTTP plumbing, it does not
loosen any control. In particular, `launch_gates.is_production_authorized()`
is checked before any endpoint that draws credit or activates a
customer account; with zero gates recorded (the honest current state),
those endpoints correctly return 403 until gates are genuinely
approved outside this repository.

AUTHENTICATION: every endpoint except the explicitly-public ones
(`/health`, `/pilot/launch-gates/status`, `GET /pilot/documents/{type}`)
and the ones with their own real authentication (`/pilot/identity/
webhook`, which verifies an HMAC signature) requires a valid API key —
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` — issued via `pilot_auth.issue_api_key()`
and checked against a specific permission from `security_controls.
ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, not a single blanket "is authenticated" gate. See
`pilot_auth.py`'s module docstring for why this is a simple,
operator-issued API-key scheme rather than full customer self-service
authentication — appropriate for a private testing deployment, not yet
a public product.
